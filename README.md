# b3vet.github.io/notifyMeJS
- Webpage that sends notifications when a change occurs in any URL.
- Works best for static webpages.
- It used to send Telegram messages when a change happens but since it requires an initial setup for the Telegram Bot, it is removed.
- Future updates will be on creating a backend for better detection and specific part detection on websites.
- CONTRIBUTE PLZ.
