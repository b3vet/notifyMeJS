# b3vet.github.io/notifyMeJS
The notify me project in js form and in a working website. Fully open-source and useable for simple websites.
There are tutorials to learn how to create a telegram bot and get the bot token and the chat id with the bot.
These information is easy to gather.
Simple things to keep in mind:
-Complex websites are not leading to correct results but works quite fine for simple websites.
-Next Update will include tracking specific parts and a Django backend probably (If I can find a free hosting service or I just might make it pay to use and use a proper django host)
-Feel free to contribute with your ideas, reach me from berkeucvet@sabanciuniv.edu
